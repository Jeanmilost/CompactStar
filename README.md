CompactStar engine

The CompactStar engine is a tiny game engine I'm using for my own purposes. With the existence of very performant and low cost, sometimes even free, 3d engine like Unity, Unreal or Panda, I know that the reasons that motivated me to write my own 3d game engine may appear somewhat strange, especially when the result is really less efficient than these engines.

However I had several reasons to do that:
1. I wanted a tiny code that I could use anywhere without difficulties. For your information I use this engine on my Windows PC, and also to create games on my iPhone, under xCode, and for the anecdote, I can even use the SDK with a small c compiler on my cell phone, which is very useful for me.
2. I'm an enthousiast game writter, but I'm alone. And as I'm not a graphist, use a high tech engine to create a game which will probably just contain really basic graphics seemed to me the same thing that buying a Ferrari to go to supermarket.
3. I wanted to learn something, and to comfront myself to the difficulty to create a such engine.

It's the reason why this engine exists. I decided to share this code freely, don't hesitate to use it if you think it useful for your purposes.
